This release has a lot of API changes, renamed and moved classes,
which was needed to implement POST support and XML namespace handling.

This won't affect most projects as they use the basic `FeatureType` functionality.
For implementations that have taken full advantage of our architecture,
the notable API changes are:

* Configuration:
  * `WFSOperation.output_formats` still works, but `get_output_formats()` is preferred.
  * `WFSOperation.parameters` is replaced by ``get_parameters()`` and only lists parameters that need to be mentioned in `GetCapabilities`.
  * The `Parameter` class only exposes choices, parsing happens in `gisserver.parsers.wfs20` now.
  * `FeatureType.xml_namespace` now defines which namespace the feature exists in (defaults to `WFSView.xml_namespace`).
* Overiding and extending queries:
  * `FeatureType.get_extent()` was replaced with ``GmlBoundedByElement.get_value()``.
  * `gisserver.operations`: renamed `WFSMethod` -> `WFSOperation`.
  * `gisserver.extensions.functions` now tracks filter function registration.
  * `gisserver.extensions.queries` now tracks stored query registration.
  * The `StoredQuery` base class is now `StoredQueryImplementation` providing a `build_query()` method.
  * The internal `CompiledQuery` moved to `gisserver.parsers.query` and receives a `feature_types` array now with a single element.
   (This change reflects the WFS spec and allowing to potentially implement JOIN queries later).
* Request parsing:
  * `WFSView.ows_request` and `request.ows_request` both provide access to the parsed WFS request.
  * `WFSOperation.parser_class` allows to define a custom parser for a additional WFS operations.
  * The WFS request parsing moved to `gisserver.parsers.wfs20`, which builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the XML request.
  * The GET request (KVP format) parsing is now a special-case of the XML-based parsing classes.
* Output formats:
  * `gisserver.output` no longer exposes the auto-switching DB/non-DB rendering aliases, as `get_output_formats()` can do that easier.
  * `OutputRenderer` only provides the basic XML aliasing, a new `CollectionOutputRenderer` base class provides the collection logic.
  * `OutputRenderer.xml_namespaces` allows defining XML namespace aliases that construct default `xmlns` attributes.
  * All rendering parameters (e.g. output CRS) moved to the `FeatureProjection` logic.
  * The `decorate_queryset()` logic is no longer a classmethod.
* Internal XSD schema elements:
  * XML tag parsing is reworked for simplicity and namespace handling.
  * Namespace aliases/prefixes are removed entirely, and resolved during rendering.
  * `FeatureType.xml_name` now returns the full XML name, not the QName.
  * `XsdTypes` use fully qualified XML names, not the QName.
  * `XsdElement.xml_name` now returns the full XML name, not the QName.
  * `XsdElement.is_geometry` was unneeded, use `XsdElement.type.is_geometry` now.
  * `XsdElement.orm_path` points to the absolute path, and `XsdElement.local_orm_path` to the relative path.
